This code exports a function that takes in config and webpack as parameters. 
It performs customizations on the webpack configuration (config) and returns the modified version. 
The code is written in JavaScript and is intended to be used as a configuration file for a webpack setup.
 The 'use strict'; directive at the top of the file is a strict mode declaration, 
 which enables strict mode for the code in the function
