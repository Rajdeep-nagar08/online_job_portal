module.exports = () => ({});


/*


This code exports a function that returns an empty object when invoked.

It starts with the "use strict" directive, which enables strict mode in the code and helps to enforce a safer coding environment by catching common coding mistakes and making them throw errors.

The function being exported is an anonymous function that takes no arguments, and when invoked returns an empty object {}.

So, when this module is imported and the function is invoked, it returns an empty object.
